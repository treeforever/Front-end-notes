# HTML

1. `data-` is to embed private data information and can be easily accessed using JS.

2. `<bdo>` bidirectional override

3. `<mark>` highlight text

4. `<canvas>` has drawing API

5. quirks mode vs standard mode: quirks mode in browser allows you to render page for as old browsers. This is for backward compatibility.

6. Why semantic html? For SEO, accessibility, light code.

7. XML is not a substitute for HTML. XML is to display structure and information. HTML is to display data.

# DOM

1. You can see `window` as a representation of browser, while `document` is the root of the document itself. `window` has console, setTimeout, localStorage and other global variables, functions, location and history under it. `document` is DOM, a object oriented representation of the html markup you have written. You can use getElementById or addEventListener on it.
